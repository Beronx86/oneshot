One long-lasting challenge in ASR is the Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) problem. When encountering a word that is not observed in the recognizer's training data, how can the recognizer detect that the word is new and not erroneously subsitute this OOV word with a similary sounding word from its vocabulary? The ability to identify new words is essentially an example of one-shot learning. However, the OOV detection problem has usually been treated as a sequential binary classification problem in the ASR community, for which classifiers are built on a rich set of features that contain information extracted from text and dictionaries~\cite{carolina,rastrow,asru,hazen}. Other methods such as augmenting the speech recognizer with a generic word model, which can generate all possible phone sequences and robustly expand the decoding search space also exist~\cite{bazzi,rastrow}. Even though the latter approach can be regarded as an analysis-by-synthesis method, this method usually exploits pre-defined lexicons and language models to help identity OOV words.
